            <h2>Domain Description</h2>
            <p>
                The domain for this application profile is a DIY-guides website where guides can be uploaded by users in various formats (video, text, image). The website will include an advanced search option with several faceted elements like Time Required and Tools Needed. The resources are the guides themselves. 
I considered user tasks and challenges when deciding which metadata elements to include. Users will be individuals who are accustomed to do it yourself projects or who are looking to get started as a do-it-yourselfer. Such individuals may have a specific item in mind that they want to create, they may be interested in renovating an entire space in their home, or they may want to supplement a skill they are building (i.e. gardening). Since the user group is diverse and has diverse needs, a variety of metadata elements are needed. Additionally, the elements should be presented in a variety of formats (written and visual) to eliminate clutter and overload. Elements on the advanced search page will be presented in a faceted manner so that users can see what options are available making navigation easier. 
I decided to create a new application profile because I could not find a pre-existing schema that met the needs of this application. Elements are sourced from Dublin Core and CDWALite. A few additional elements were created using my application namespace UTK. 
            </p>
            <h2>Domain Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                To begin my analysis of this collection I looked for websites that hosted DIY guides and determined what elements were common and which I felt where lacking when I placed myself in the position of a user. These examples always began with a category selection. Often there was a subcategory as well. For example, on <a href="diy-guides.com">diy-guides.com</a> you can select the sub-category of Fruits from Gardening & Plants. The information presented for each record includes a title, description, image, and statement about the user who posted the guide, when, and under which category. On the right hand side is a simple panel that allows the user to search the website, or select a category and sub-category.  I second website I analyzed was <a href="diy-extra.co.uk">diy-extra.co.uk</a>. This site also includes a category and sub-category selection process. Once a sub-category is selected the user is presented with records in tile format. Each tile contains a large image, the categories it appears in, title, keywords/tags, and a description. There is no panel for refining the search, though a search bar does appear in the top right. As someone who often takes on DIY projects I found the displayed and searchable metadata on these site to be lacking in detail. Since this project does not include user research I have to base my choices on which additional elements to include off of my own experience. Thus I determined to add the guide content/item so that it would be clear what was being created in cases where the category and sub-category did not describe this (i.e. Item: Dining room table in the category/sub-category: Home Improvement:Kitchen). I also added a list of materials needed, the tools required, the time required, related items, and a rating. Finally, I decided to include the format of the guide as I know many people have preferences for video guides or written/image guides.
            </p>

		The following are 17 metadata elements that I have identified as important for users.

           The process of creating an application profile was challenging but I learned a lot about metadata along the way. I started with a domain analysis to determine what elements I needed. The analysis was similar to UX testing, which I was already familiar with, in that I did a basic review of a couple of websites with a similar application and determined what worked and what needed improvement. My focus in the domain analysis was much narrower than that of a real UX test however since I was only evaluating metadata elements. I enjoyed this part of the process because it was similar to an activity I was already familiar with. Next, I set about creating the element specification set and matching my chosen elements to namespaces. I found that starting with the Dublin Core set of elements made this task much easier because it helped me to realize that my elements were too narrowly focused for my audience. Dublin Core is so prevalent because of its simplicity and since my application involves asking users to add metadata values I thought simplifying my expectations made sense. In the simplification process I was able to match many of my elements to pre-existing Dublin Core elements. For the elements that didn’t match the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) was used as a namespace. Dr. Dobreski pointed out to me however that AAT is meant to be used as a controlled vocabulary. This fact seems clear to me now but it really wasn’t when I first started this process. Instead I opted to use a combination of CDWALite and a local namespace defined at UTK. I know that many of my classmates struggled with the idea of the local namespace but I felt that I was able to grasp this concept early on and that is likely due to the fact that I needed it for several elements like Rating and Number of Raters.  
        </p>

	   In assignment 3 we moved on to creating an XSD file. I really appreciated the reverse engineering technique that was shown in class because it started us with an XML file, something we had worked with before. I found creating the basic XSD file simple and decided to try adding namespace values. This presented a challenge for me. A few emails with Dr. Dobreski later I managed to successfully create a working XSD file though I’m not sure what I had done wrong the first time. Along with my XSD file 3 namespace XSD files were also created. In order to edit the attributes on my application profile XSD I first had to edit them on the namespace XSD files. This was a bit difficult to figure out and also meant that when sharing my XSD file I had to include the other 3 XSD files or else my attributes would show an error. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Finally, by the time I was ready to create a website to host my project I also realized that my element set was lacking in a few ways. Some of my elements needed wrappers, some needed to be mandatory instead of optional, some elements weren’t needed at all, and some elements had to be added. I think the fact that I was able to see and correct these problems is a great indication of how much I’ve learned. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		At this point I feel a lot more confident in my understanding of what metadata, how it works, and how I can use it.
