            <h2>Domain Description</h2>
            <p>
                The domain for this application profile is a DIY-guides website where guides can be uploaded by users in various formats (video, text, image). The website will include an advanced search option with several faceted elements like Time Required and Tools Needed. The resources are the guides themselves. 
I considered user tasks and challenges when deciding which metadata elements to include. Users will be individuals who are accustomed to do it yourself projects or who are looking to get started as a do-it-yourselfer. Such individuals may have a specific item in mind that they want to create, they may be interested in renovating an entire space in their home, or they may want to supplement a skill they are building (i.e. gardening). Since the user group is diverse and has diverse needs, a variety of metadata elements are needed. Additionally, the elements should be presented in a variety of formats (written and visual) to eliminate clutter and overload. Elements on the advanced search page will be presented in a faceted manner so that users can see what options are available making navigation easier. 
I decided to create a new application profile because I could not find a pre-existing schema that met the needs of this application. Elements are sourced from Dublin Core and CDWALite. A few additional elements were created using my application namespace UTK.

            <h2>Domain Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                To begin my analysis of this collection I looked for websites that hosted DIY guides and determined what elements were common and which I felt where lacking when I placed myself in the position of a user. These examples always began with a category selection. Often there was a subcategory as well. For example, on diy-guides.com you can select the sub-category of Fruits from Gardening & Plants. The information presented for each record includes a title, description, image, and statement about the user who posted the guide, when, and under which category. On the right hand side is a simple panel that allows the user to search the website, or select a category and sub-category.  I second website I analyzed was diy-extra.co.uk. This site also includes a category and sub-category selection process. Once a sub-category is selected the user is presented with records in tile format. Each tile contains a large image, the categories it appears in, title, keywords/tags, and a description. There is no panel for refining the search, though a search bar does appear in the top right. As someone who often takes on DIY projects I found the displayed and searchable metadata on these site to be lacking in detail. Since this project does not include user research I have to base my choices on which additional elements to include off of my own experience. Thus I determined to add the guide content/item so that it would be clear what was being created in cases where the category and sub-category did not describe this (i.e. Item: Dining room table in the category/sub-category: Home Improvement:Kitchen). I also added a list of materials needed, the tools required, the time required, related items, and a rating. Finally, I decided to include the format of the guide as I know many people have preferences for video guides or written/image guides.
The following are 17 metadata elements that I have identified as important for users.
